i) This program is designed to recommend a film to the user using the Natural Language Processing of SpaCy. A selection of films and their descriptions are read in through a txt file and then SpaCy is used to identify the most similar film against the userâ€™s previous choice. For this example the previous choice is a film called planet Hulk. SpaCy determines a films similarity and presents it as a decimal between the values of 0.0 and 1.0.

ii) For this program to work the user needs to install SpaCy on their system. The user must also have the movies.txt file in the same directory.
